# Pytorch-based-Player-Scoreboard-Game
This Pytorch-based program simulates a player scoreboard game where 4 players compete to reach a score of 10 while avoiding elimination.
The program generates scores every second and updates the scores of the players, declares winners,
and removes eliminated players from the scoreboard in real-time.
